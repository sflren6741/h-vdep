## Introduction
H-VDEP (Valuing Defense by Estimating Probabilities in Handball) is a machine learning‐based metric for evaluating team defense in handball. By predicting the probabilities of key defensive events—conceded goals, fouls, and fast breaks—H-VDEP quantitatively assesses the risk and value of each defensive action. This repository provides the code to compute H-VDEP.  
If you have any questions or issues, please contact the author.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- To install dependencies, run:  
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Evaluation from Scratch

### Step 1: Downloading the Required Data
Please download the necessary datasets from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_DRIVE_LINK):
- `handball_match_data.xlsx`: Annotation data.
- `tracking_data.json`: Player coordinate data.
- `videos`: Raw match videos (optional for extracting player positions).

### Step 2: Running the Code and Checking the Results
1. Execute the analysis script:  
   `python3 run_H-VDEP.py`
2. Review the generated figures in the `results` folder.
